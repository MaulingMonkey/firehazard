Playing around with Win32 security APIs to understand/grok/document/wrap them.

## ⚠️ Warning ⚠️
I'm not subscribed to any security lists.
I don't have anything alerting me to CVEs.
I don't have any PGP keys for you to securely send me security bugs.
This isn't backed by a team or company.
I have no code reviewers.
I haven't fuzz tested anything.
My test coverage is mediocre.
There is no red team.
I haven't made a proper attempt to bypass even the example sandbox.
Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean that they aren't out to get you.
Rust has made me overconfident.
Rust has made **you** overconfident.
The false sense of security that using this code will lure you into, may be worse than nothing at all.
