/// â‰ˆ PROCESS_MITIGATION_DEP_POLICY
///
/// Data Execution Prevention (DEP) policies, preventing the execution of arbitrary data.
/// This makes the exploitation of buffer overflows for code execution vulnerabilities more difficult.
/// On modern systems and build setups, this is configured for you by default.
///
/// ### Example
///
/// ```
/// # use firehazard::*;
/// # use winapi::shared::winerror::ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED;
/// #
/// // Already enabled:
/// let dep : process::mitigation::DepPolicy = get_process_mitigation_policy(get_current_process()).unwrap();
/// assert!(dep.enable);
/// assert!(dep.disable_atl_thunk_emulation);
/// assert!(dep.permanent);
///
/// // Cannot modify:
/// assert_eq!(ERROR_NOT_SUPPORTED, set_process_mitigation_policy(dep).unwrap_err());
/// ```
///
