Create a *fire hazard* by locking down your <span style="opacity: 50%">(Microsoft)</span> *Windows* so nobody can *escape* (your security sandbox.)<br>
Unopinionated low level API bindings focused on soundness, safety, and stronger types over raw FFI.<br>
You may be *at hazard* of being *fired* (or worse) for relying on this crate for security:

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings ‚ö†Ô∏è
* `0.0.0-yyyy-mm-dd` doesn't follow semver.
* I'm not subscribed to any security lists.
* I don't have anything alerting me to CVEs.
* This crate is probably not 100% sound.  Bug reports welcome.
* I don't have any PGP keys for you to securely send me security bugs.
* Keep flammable materials away from heaters and other ignition sources.
* This isn't backed by a team or company.  Nor me, frankly.
* I have no code reviewers.
* I haven't fuzz tested anything.
* My test coverage is mediocre.
* There is no red team.
* I haven't made a proper attempt to bypass even the example sandbox.
* Just because you're paranoid, doesn't mean that they aren't out to get you.
* Rust has made me overconfident.
* Rust has made **you** overconfident.
* Keep emergency exits accessible and usable to avoid fire safety hazards.
* The false sense of security - that using this code will lure you into - may be worse than nothing at all.
* Test your fire alarms.  The batteries are probably dead.
